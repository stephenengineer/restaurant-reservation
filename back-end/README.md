# Capstone: Restaurant Reservation System Backend

### App Interface:

- Built to interface with the Periodic Tables Front End Application: [restaurant-reservation-front-end](https://github.com/stephenengineer/starter-restaurant-reservation/tree/main/front-end). This API is meant to provide the app with URL routes and back end data for accessing, altering, and deleting data for reservations and tables.

See [../README.md](../README.md) for detailed instructions.
